The site allows a connected user :
 - Have a random joke
 - Have a random joke from an categories
 - Collect all jokes that contain a keyword
From the api : api.chucknorris.io

You can find an Easter egg on this site but it is not from me, I only modified the code to be consistent with the theme of the site and added an option to decline.
You can find the source on the easter egg page's.
